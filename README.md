o	Built a front-end application using Flutter development platform. The application has a Google Maps screen and a sign in and sign up page where users are able to login into their existing account or create a new user.	Users can track waste nearby by placing and viewing marks on the map, which indicate that thereâ€™s waste on the marked location.	Used Google Map APIs to integrate Google Maps services into the app and used Firebase to authenticate users.
